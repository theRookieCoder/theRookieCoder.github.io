Hello, and welcome to my website! I suppose you want to learn more about me... interesting choice.

I like to read story books, my preferred genres are science fiction (surprise surprise) and fantasy. Some of my favourite books are
- [The Witcher](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40911-the-witcher)
- [Harry Potter](https://www.goodreads.com/series/45175-harry-potter)
- [River of Ink](https://www.goodreads.com/series/201124-river-of-ink)
- [Chronicle of the Dark Star](https://www.goodreads.com/series/179730-chronicle-of-the-dark-star)
- [Maze Runner](https://www.goodreads.com/series/110451-the-maze-runner)
- [39 Clues](https://www.goodreads.com/series/45556-the-39-clues) and its spinoff series

Twisty puzzles are awesome, particularly when it involves a lot of thinking. I can solve the 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 7x7 (mostly), Square-1, and Mirror Cube. At one point, I was averaging around 30 seconds to solve a 3x3.

I play video games on occasion. I've spent significant time on
- [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net)
- [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://zelda.nintendo.com/breath-of-the-wild)
- [The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://zelda.nintendo.com/tears-of-the-kingdom)
- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)

Oh and did I mention I like mathematics. I love having tools to model real world problems, and solve them precisely. But I don't plan on pursuing maths academically, high school maths was enough fun for me.

But beyond all of that, my **passion** is computers. To say that I *love* computers would be an understatement; my friends like to say that my one true beloved is my laptop. The ability to generalise solutions to problems is what attracted 10 year old me to programming, and is what still motivates me to this day.

# My Story with Computers

My dad likes to code at home as a hobby. A few years ago, he was learning Swift to create apps, and I approached him to learn about what he was doing. He opened a REPL and showed me how you could assign numbers to letters (variables) and compute the result of operations on them. I was amazed, and the part of this that attracted me the most was that the computer didn't care what values were in the variables, it computed the result regardless. While I had used computer before, this experience made me understand their significance, and I was excited to take advantage of this.

The first language I learned was Python. At the time, I was learning a solution to a type of word problem that used the guess and check method (this was before we learned algebra). So, the first program I made solved this type of word problem by getting values from the user, and trying a few estimates to see if the answer is right. After this, I created a few more programs with Python, for example one program randomly generates test questions for me to practise using a soroban.

I got an Arduino and Raspberry Pi the next year, and I really liked that I could control electronic devices in the real world using my code. But the programming really ramped up when I was 13. My dad had bought a course online for Flutter, and he wanted me to try and learn creating apps as well. After completing Secondary 1, I had a gap as I moved countries, and I thoroughly utilised this time to learn Flutter.

My approach to learning has always been hands-on. I do not have the patience to read tutorials or watch courses, I prefer to start a project and learn along the way. My first Flutter project was an app that logged blood pressure and stored it in Google Drive. You can have a look at [BP Logger](https://github.com/theRookieCoder/bp_logger) on GitHub. It taught me a lot about interfacing with APIs on the internet, setting up Google sign-in using Firebase, and creating useful UIs in Flutter. I also published a library, [Drive Helper](https://pub.dev/packages/drive_helper), to isolate the sign in and file read/write, and make it available to others.

The next leap for me was Rust. I had seen many memes about Rust on [r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor), and I wanted to see what the fuss was about.
