It was the 12th of June. School reopened as usual after a sweltering summer break, and I was excited to meet my friends again after a long time. Unfortunately, we had examinations coming up in just a few days, and I was *really* not looking forward to that. It was in this mixed state of emotions that my computer science teacher approached my friend and me.

We have a Student Council in my school, and every year secondary and higher secondary students, from 7th to 12th grade, get to vote for the Head Boy and Head Girl posts.
